  Synchronize eclass deadlines with google calendar.

** Dependencies
   This script is dependent on a couple of packages. If you use pip
   you will need:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ sudo pip install gdata.calendar.data \
   gdata.calendar.client \
   BeautifulSoup \
   mechanize
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Usage
   It is quite simple really. Use =--eclass= and =--google= to provide
   eclass and google credentials in the form =username:password= and
   =email:password= respectively. See =--help= too. The default
   calendar is always used. I may add support for other calendars
   aswell later. The default eclass url is upatras. Edit the
   ECLASS_URL variable at the top of the script to change that.
